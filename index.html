							<p>Although Pericles assisted in the installation of democracy in Athens as well as bring the state to its golden age, making it a beacon for art and learning he was also responsible for the eventual destruction of Athens through the Peloponnesian war. Pericles was responsible in the outbreak of the Peloponnesian war by betraying his allies, excessively attacking his enemy and using its power to bully other surrounding states. 
							</p>
						</div>
						<div id="spartainfo2">
							<p>This bullying pushed Sparta into going to war with Athens again only after fifteen years but this time Pericles was prepared, he called for all Athenians to come behind the safety of the walls. This was done because Pericles knew that if he had gone into open battle with the Spartans then he would surely loose. Meanwhile the Spartans burned the farms and small villages that surrounded Athens, this did not affect the Athenians though because they were being supplied by ally ships from the port that was also protected by the wall. Soon after being behind the wall, a plague spread throughout the city and over 30,000 Athenians died, among the dead was Pericles . After the death of Pericles the democracy he helped establish became the undoing of Athens in the Peloponnesian war. Because the people had complete control of who their leader was, the only demagogues (politicians) elected were ones that did whatever the people wanted. One of the weak leaders was named Alcibiades and he encouraged the Athenians to send all of their forces to attack the small island of Sicily in order to expand their empire and boost morale. This plan ended in catastrophic failure leaving only a small portion of Athens once great fleet left. Persia saw this moment as the time for them to get revenge on the city that had bullied them for years and gave Sparta gold to build a bigger fleet to destroy the Athenians once and for all. </p>
						</div>
						<div id="spartainfo3">
							<p>With this huge amount of gold he rebuilt the temples that the Persians had destroyed as well as a new meeting hall. Pericles encouraged sculptors, architects, artisans and scholars to come and practice their work in Athens. As a result Athens became a shining beacon of beauty and knowledge. Pericles changed the policies of Athens as well. He introduced a higher restriction on Athenian citizenship, letting only children of an Athenian mother and father as opposed to just an Athenian father become citizens. Other policies included Jurors being paid for giving their time which encouraged all citizens to contribute instead of just the rich, this allowed for a true view of the Athenian people’s opinion not just the elite. Pericles allowed even the poorest Athenians to attend the theatre by paying for their entry fee. Pericles’ goal of these changes was to make Athens the most powerful city on earth. As a way to physically embody this goal, he commissioned many of the architects and sculptors he had brought to Athens to build the Parthenon. Built from marble quarried from Mt. Penteli, the Parthenon was a feat of Architectural genius. The reason for this is because it was created as an optical illusion, appearing straight but actually having a curved foundation as well as pillars of different sizes but appearing the same, the Parthenon became what Pericles hoped it to be, an embodiment of the golden age of Athens. </p>

								<p>During the breakdown of the Delian League and the growth of Athens, the Spartans were the head state of another group of mainland states named the Peloponnesian League. Meanwhile in Sparta, the slave race that served the Spartans (the Helots) were on the verge of a revolution. Because of this revolution the Spartans called to the now powerful Athenians for assistance. Once the Athenian force arrived at Sparta’s border they were turned away because the Spartans feared the size of the Athenian force and thought they may have actually been there to invade. This was a great insult to the Athenians. Offences like this occurred back and forth for the next few years until two states belonging to the Peloponnesian league (Corinth and Megara)  began fighting. The Athenians, eager to take hold of the inland of Greece aided Megara in the fight. This gave Sparta no choice but to help Corinth. The fighting between the states lasted for fifteen years which ended in the signing of the thirty year peace treaty. During this treaty, Pericles built a wall around Athens and its port (Piraeus) which shows that Pericles was getting ready to fight. This accusation is also supported by the fact that Pericles began to bully the states around Athens even more than he had been previously doing. 
								</p>
							</div>
							<div id="athensinfo2">
								<p>After invading Persians were driven out of Greece, the Greek populace decide that the Persians should be punished for the damage they inflicted on their country. As a result of this common goal, most of the coastline cities formed a group called the Delian League. The head state of the Delian League was Athens and at the head of Athens sat Pericles. The Delian league sent frequent tributes of soldiers and ships to Athens and sent gold and other raw materials to the treasury at Delos. The Delian League attacked the Persians with speed and ferocity so that by the time the Persian army arrived at the town that was being attacked by the League there would be nothing left. There were also cases of the League installing democracies in the defeated cities and turned the towns against the Persian rulers. The loot that the Delian Leagues army was able to secure made the member states of the League rich, especially so for Athens. After the Persians were utterly defeated the members of the League eventually grew tired of attacking and believed that a just punishment was given for their crime. This was the case for everyone but Athens who had grown incredibly rich through the raids on Persia’s cities as well as the tributes sent to them from the other Delian League states. The other cities began to send only raw resources toward the war effort and let the Athenians do all the fighting.  Cities that did not pay the tribute were bullied and reminded that the Athenians now owned a massive naval fleet that could easily attack them if they didn’t comply. Now that Pericles was the leader of a massive fleet and no longer had to answer to the Delian League he raided the treasury of Delos. </p>
							</div>
							<div id="athensinfo3">
								<p>Pericles was responsible for the outbreak of the Peloponnesian war for many reasons. The initial excessive punishment of the Persians for their initial invasion of Greece later gave them incentive to help the Spartans in destroying Athens. The bullying of what once was the Delian League made the surrounding states not stop the Spartans from attacking the Athenians. Finally interfering in a purely Peloponnesian affair in an effort to expand Athenian influence angered the Spartans which ultimately led to Athens destruction.</p>
